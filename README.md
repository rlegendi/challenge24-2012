Challange24 - 2012 - Solutions
==============================

This project contains solutions I tried for the [12th Challenge24 contest][1] in 2012.

You can find some [additional notes on my blog][2] about the contest.

You can find the problem descriptions and all the input test files and under [doc][3] directory.

The [sol][4] directory contains the solution output files.

The solutions of *Task A* should be correct, because all of them was accepted when I submitted them through the web form of the contest.

Under the [src][5] directory, you can find the sourcecode of the solutions I managed to solve so far.

Task A
------
Well, this is what I managed to solve during the contest. Bit of ugly hack: I created 4 different rotated versions of the same image and searched for only 2 type of triangles. Ugly, but solved it in 1.5 hour ;-)
