Challange24 - 2012 - Solutions
==============================

This project contains solutions I tried for the [12th Challenge24 contest][1] in 2012.

You can find some [additional notes on my blog][2] about the contest.

You can find the problem descriptions and all the input test files and under [doc/PROBLEMSET][3] directory.

The [sol][4] directory contains the solution output files.

The solutions of *Task A* should be correct, because all of them was accepted when I submitted them through the web form of the contest.

Under the [src][5] directory, you can find the sourcecode of the solutions I managed to solve so far.

Task A

Well, this is what I managed to solve during the contest
