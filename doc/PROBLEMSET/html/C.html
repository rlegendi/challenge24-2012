<h2>C. Lumberjack</h2>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">
<p>
A lumberjack has to cut down N trees which were planted
along a straight line with fixed distance between them.
<p>
If the lumberjack cuts down a tree he can make it fall
either left or right along the line.
A tree can topple another tree if it falls on it and may
cause the fall of many other trees (by the domino effect).
<p>
Which trees should the lumberjack cut down so that all
trees fall with the minimum number of cuts?

<p>
Constraints of the domino effect:
<ul>
<li>The height of the ith tree is H[i], 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N
<li>If tree i falls left then all standing trees j fall left as well for i-H[i] &lt; j &lt; i
<li>If tree i falls right then all standing trees j fall right as well for i &lt; j &lt; i+H[i]
<li>A tree can only fall once
</ul>

<h3>Input</h3>
<pre>
N
H[1] H[2] ... H[N]
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>
<pre>
K
T[1] T[2] ... T[K]
</pre>
K is the optimal number of tree cuts.
The absolute value of T[i] is the index of the ith tree that is cut down.
(Note that the order in which trees are cut down may matter.)
T[i] is negative if tree T[i] falls left.

<h3>Example</h3>
<table width=100% align=left border=1>
<tr>
<th width=50%>Input
<th width=50%>Output


<tr><td>
<pre>
5
1 2 3 1 1
</pre>

<td>
<p>
Two of the possible outputs are
<pre>
2
3 -2
</pre>
or
<pre>
2
1 2
